\hspace{10mm} When Glaukos, the prince of Crete, went missing, the king and queen were told by the Oracle of Delphi that the person to find their son would be the one who could compose the best simile on the hide of the newborn calf of the king's herd. The seer, \textbf{Polúeidos}, observed the similarity of the changing color of the calf's fur to the ripening of the mulberry, and so was tasked with finding the prince.

\begingroup
\hspace{10mm} Polúeidos divined that Glaukos would be found dead at the bottom of a barrel of honey, where he had fallen in while attempting to dip his finger for a taste. When the prince was found, the queen was enraged at the seer for returning their son dead. She ordered he be sealed in the crypt with Glaukos, and not released until he produced the boy, alive. 
\endgroup

\begingroup
\hspace{10mm} Hours into his imprisonment, Polúeidos saw a snake on the body of the prince, so threw it on the ground, crushing its head with his heel. Following, another snake saw its dead kin, and rushed out of the crypt to return with an herb which, when chewed and spat into the mouth of the dead snake, brought it back to life. Polúeidos, recognizing the herb, demanded of the guards that it be brought to him, and upon chewing it and spitting it into Glaukos' mouth, the prince arose. 
\endgroup

\begingroup
\hspace{10mm} The queen refused to allow Polúeidos to return to his home in Corinth until he had taught her son all of his occult knowledge. After many years of instruction, the seer had taught Glaukos everything, and so was ready to go home. Before his departure, at the dock, Polúeidos offered Glaukos a final lesson, wherein he spat in the mouth of the prince. As the prince swallowed the fluid, watching the seer's ship float over the horizon, he realized that all of the knowledge he had gained from Polúeidos' tutelage was vanishing from his mind.
